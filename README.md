## 🔥 R U L E S

💻 Backend Engineering:

    I prioritize thorough testing, using Onion Architecture and DDD to align code with business logic.
    !! But only when the complexity justifies it.


📊 Databases:

    PostgreSQL & MongoDB — but hey, don’t go wild adding constraints and `NOT NULL` everywhere 😅

🛠 DevOps & Tooling:

    Docker + Docker Compose for smooth container life  

    Don’t be afraid — just GitHub Actions with CI and some pre-commit hooks, that’s it  

📱 Mobile:

    Flutter — one codebase to rule both iOS and Android ✨
