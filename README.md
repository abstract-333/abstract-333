## 🔥 R U L E S

💻 Backend Engineering:

    Add tests, implement TDD (yeah, it's tough on the backend — feels more frontend-y sometimes)

    DDD for structuring complexity and aligning code with real-world logic

📊 Databases:

    PostgreSQL & MongoDB — but hey, don’t go wild adding constraints and `NOT NULL` everywhere 😅

🛠 DevOps & Tooling:

    Docker + Docker Compose for smooth container life  

    Don’t be afraid — just GitHub Actions with CI and some pre-commit hooks, that’s it  

📱 Mobile & Cross-Platform:

    Flutter — one codebase to rule both iOS and Android ✨
